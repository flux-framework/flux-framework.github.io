# Release Notes

flux-sched version 0.28.0 - 2023-07-11
--------------------------------------

This release fixes a critical bug ([#1043](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1043)) where resources that are allocated
to a job that exceeds its time limit could be re-allocated to a new job while
the first job is still in CLEANUP state.

### New Features

 * reapi: implement find ([#1020](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1020))

### Fixes

 * Prevent allocation of currently allocated resources ([#1046](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1046))
 * mark all ranks known to graph when "all" is specified ([#1042](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1042))
 * planner: ensure result in planner_avail_resources_at ([#1038](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1038))

### Build/Testsuite

 * testsuite: t1024-alloc-check.t: do not fail if rank 0 not drained ([#1047](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1047))
 * testsuite: add test for double-booking ([#1044](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1044))
 * Add false positives typos config ([#1030](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1030))
 * Update sphinx version ([#1032](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1032))
 * ensure licenses appear in distribution tarball ([#1031](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1031))
 * add spell check for news and readme ([#1021](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1021))
 * build: add `make deb` target to build test debian package ([#1024](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1024))
 * testsuite: drop meaningless check ([#1023](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1023))
 * testsuite: make module list awk less fragile ([#1022](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/1022))
