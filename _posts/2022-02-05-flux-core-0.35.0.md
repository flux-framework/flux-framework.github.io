# Release Notes

This release fixes a broker crash when a job receives an exception after
running a job prolog. Users of the prolog/epilog feature should update
to this version as soon as possible.

In addition, TCP keepalive support was added for detection of powered off
compute nodes.  For configuration info, see the Flux Admin Guide:
