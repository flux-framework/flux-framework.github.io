# Release Notes

This release includes several improvements in the recursive tooling
in Flux to enhance the user experience when dealing with nested jobs.

Highlights include:

 * Improved interface for job URI discovery allows `flux proxy` and
   `flux top` to target jobids directly.
 * Addition of a `-R, --recursive` option to `flux jobs`
 * Support in `flux top` for selecting and recursing into sub-instances
 * A new  `flux pstree` command for displaying job hierarchies in a tree

### Fixes

 * systemd: fix typo in flux.service unit file ([#3996](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3996))
 * libflux: check reactor flags ([#4014](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4014))
 * fix uninterruptible hang when attached to terminated jobs with -o pty
   ([#4010](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4010))
 * cmd/flux-jobs: re-work -A option and clarify -a option ([#4012](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4012))
 * broker: avoid inappropriate quorum.timeout ([#4027](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4027))
 * add workaround for invalid job timeouts when system is busy ([#4037](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4037))

   discovery ([#3999](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3999))

   flux-proxy ([#4004](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4004), [#4015](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4015))
 * flux-top: allow top to recursively call itself ([#4011](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4011))
 * flux-jobs: add --recursive option ([#4019](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4019), [#4024](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4024))
