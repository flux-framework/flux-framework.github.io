# Release Notes

This release adds early groundwork for recovering running jobs across a
Flux restart.  It also includes improved log messages based on user feedback
about Flux failures on real workflow runs, a first draft of a new `flux top`
tool, and a critical fix for system deployments of Flux ([#3958](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3958)).

 * libflux: improve safety against refcounting bugs in message functions ([#3985](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3985))
 * shell: reject PMI clients that request v2 ([#3953](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3953))
