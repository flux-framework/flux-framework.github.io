# Release Notes

#### Fixes

* `bank_table`'s primary key is now a fixed type ([#42](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-accounting/issues/42))

* `bank_table`'s subcommands no longer impose constraints on values of shares ([#44](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-accounting/issues/44))

* `print-hierarchy`'s format improved to represent a bank and user hierarchy ([#51](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-accounting/issues/51))
