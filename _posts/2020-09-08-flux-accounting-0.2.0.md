# Release Notes

This release adds a new table to the flux-accounting database and a front end to flux-core's job-archive.

#### Features

* Add a new table `bank_table` that stores bank information for users to charge jobs against.

* Add a front-end interface to flux-core's job-archive to fetch job record information and sort it with customizable parameters, such as by username, before or after a specific time, or with a specific job ID.
