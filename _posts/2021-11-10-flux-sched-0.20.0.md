# Release Notes
This version of Fluxion lays a foundation for
node-exclusive scheduling, which will
use a moldable jobspec to match every node-local
resource of each selected compute node.

### Fixes

 * jobspec: make max/operator/operand optional ([#879](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/879))
 * resource: improve effective max calc performance for operator="+"
   ([#882](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/882))
 * resource: beefing up min/max count-based matching ([#878](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/878))

### Cleanup

 * build: drop ax_python_devel.m4 ([#881](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/881))
