* Avoid putting the Flux `libpmi.so` in the system `ld.so` path on systems
where Flux is installed to the default system prefix, as this could
interfere with MPI runtimes under other resource managers.
* Enable the SQLite backing store for the KVS by default, which
addresses unchecked memory growth in the rank 0 broker.
* Stability and usability improvements to the `flux-hwloc` subcommand,
and `resource-hwloc` comms module.
* Added the `flux-version` subcommand.
* Build system fixes.
* Test suite fixes.
