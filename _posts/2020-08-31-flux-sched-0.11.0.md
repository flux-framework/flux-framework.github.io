# Release Notes

Note: Fluxion can now annotate its jobs with their
start-time estimate and queue info (to be displayed by `flux-jobs`).

### Fixes
 * Handle invalid sibling requests in jobspecs more gracefully ([#737](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/737))
 * Fix various errors detected when tests are run under valgrind ([#734](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/734))
 * fluxion-resource: check return value of `find_first_not_of` ([#715](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/715))

### Features
 * Add support for job annotation including its start-time estimate ([#735](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/735))
 * Add support for node-local storage to hwloc reader ([#714](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/714))
 * flux module load returns early for staggered system-instance bring-up ([#719](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/719))

### Cleanup
 * Update for non-integer jobid encodings ([#718](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/718))
 * Use version 9999 for test jobspecs ([#739](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/739))
