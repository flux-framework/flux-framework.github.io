# Release Notes

This release includes two noteworthy system instance improvements:
crashed/offline nodes now marked offline for scheduling, and support
has been added for prolog/epilog scripts that run as root.

For prolog/epilog setup info, see the Flux Admin Guide:

https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adminguide.html

### Fixes
 * build: allow python 3.10.0 to satisfy version check ([#3939](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3939))
 * resource: avoid scheduling on nodes that have crashed ([#3930](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3930))
 * broker: fail gracefully when rundir or local-uri exceed `AF_UNIX` path
   limits ([#3932](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3932))
 * broker: ignore missing ldconfig when searching for libpmi.so ([#3926](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3926))
 * job-manager: fix running job count underflow and use-after-free when an
   event is emitted in CLEANUP state ([#3922](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3922))
 * fix problems building flux when 0MQ is not installed as a system package
   ([#3917](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3917))
 * python: do not auto-stop ProgressBar by default ([#3914](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3914))

### New Features
 * support job prolog/epilog commands ([#3934](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3934))
 * job-manager: add prolog/epilog support for jobtap plugins ([#3924](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3924))
 * libidset: add high level set functions ([#3915](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3915))
 * kvs: optionally initialize namespace to a root reference ([#3941](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3941))
 * rc: load job-archive module in default rc ([#3942](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3942))

### Cleanup
 * improve broker overlay logging and debugging capability ([#3913](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3913))
 * man: Add note about shell quoting/escaping ([#3918](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3918))

### Test
 * mergify: set queue method to merge, not rebase ([#3916](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3916))
 * mergify: replace strict merge with queue+rebase ([#3907](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/3907))
