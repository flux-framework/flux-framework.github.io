# Release Notes

This release disables resource verification of GPUs by default to
workaround issues with GPU detection with system versions of hwloc.

### Fixes

 * resource: restrict resource verification to cores/hostnames only ([#4192](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4192))
 * resource: assign ranks in R based on hostlist attribute ([#4188](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4188))
 * add assertions that rank, size, hostlist broker attributes are cacheable
   ([#4187](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4187))

### Testsuite

 * testsuite: fix racy tests in t0005-rexec ([#4179](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4179))

### Cleanup

 * build: ensure autogen.sh updates package version ([#4174](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/4174))
