## Release Notes

## Summary:
This version of flux-sched integrates our new graph-based
scheduler with the new execution system within flux-core.
For this purpose, it introduces the qmanager module that
can easily enforce various queuing and backfilling policies
on batch jobs while serving as a conduit between our resource
matching service and flux-core's job-manager. In addition,
it adds a new resource match policy that considers
the performance class of each compute node as a constraint
for scheduling to handle the natural performance variations
of modern microprocessors. Finally, this version lays some
of the foundational work to allow flux-sched to ultimately
reconstruct its state using the queue state of job-manager
for resiliency.
