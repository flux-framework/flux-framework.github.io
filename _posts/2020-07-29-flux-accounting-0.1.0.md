# Release Notes

Initial release.

#### Features

* Create an accounting database which stores user account information. Can interact with database through SQLite shell or
through a command line interface to add and remove users, edit account values, and view account information.

* Add **Makefile** to allow flux-accounting to be installed alongside flux-core so that flux-accounting commands can be picked up by Flux's command driver.
