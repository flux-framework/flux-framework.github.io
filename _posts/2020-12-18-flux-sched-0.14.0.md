# Release Notes

Note: In support of fully hierarchical scheduling for our
workflow users, Fluxion is now capable of correctly
discovering and scheduling GPUs at any level of nesting.

### Fixes
 * ci: drop unnecessary flux keygen ([#788](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/788))
 * shell: reduce logging verbosity of datastaging plugin ([#779](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/779))
 * t0000-sharness.sh: fix test with debug/verbose set in env ([#784](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/784))
 * codecov: ignore vendored json.hpp ([#774](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/774))

### Features
  * use RV1+JGF JSON from resource.acquire to populate graph data store ([#787](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/787))
  * execution target and core/gpu Id remapping support for nesting ([#773](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/773), [#787](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/787))

### Cleanup
  * Globally rename "administrative priority" to "urgency" ([#781](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched/issues/781))
